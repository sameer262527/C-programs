# C++ OOP Concepts Repository

Welcome to the C++ OOP Concepts repository! This project covers fundamental and advanced concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++. It includes a wide range of C++ programs that illustrate core programming principles. This repository does not focus on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), but instead is centered on understanding C++ through practical implementations.

# Introduction
This repository serves as a learning resource for understanding C++ OOP principles. Each folder contains C++ programs that demonstrate specific features or concepts, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Concepts Covered

- **Basics of C++**
  - Fundamental syntax, variables, control structures
  - Data types and operators
- **Functions and Pointers**
  - Function declarations and definitions
  - Pointers, pointer arithmetic, and function pointers
- **Classes and Objects**
  - Defining classes and creating objects
  - Access specifiers (public, private, protected)
  - Member functions
- **Constructors and Destructors**
  - Types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy constructor)
  - Destructor usage and importance
- **Operator Overloading**
  - Overloading arithmetic, relational, and assignment operators
  - Overloading the insertion (`<<`) and extraction (`>>`) operators
- **Inheritance**
  - Single, multiple, multilevel inheritance
  - Virtual functions and polymorphism
- **Exception Handling**
  - `try`, `catch`, and `throw` for handling exceptions
  - Custom exceptions
- **Templates**
  - Function and class templates
  - Generic programming concepts
- **File I/O**
  - Reading and writing files using `fstream`, `ifstream`, `ofstream`
  - Binary and text file operations
